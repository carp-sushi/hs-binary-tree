# binary-tree

A binary search tree â€“ an exercise implementing common type-classes in Haskell.

This project implements or derives the following type-classes:

* Semigroup
* Applicative
* Monad
* Foldable
* Functor
* Traversable

The tests verify basic operations and attempt to verify the following laws:

* Functor
  * Identity
  * Composition
* Applicative
  * Identity
  * Composition
  * Associative Composition
  * Homomorphism
  * Interchange
* Monad
  * Associativity
  * Apply Superclass
  * Left Identity
  * Right Identity
